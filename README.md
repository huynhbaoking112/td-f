    <b><a href="#">Flutter Todo App</a></b>
</h1>

A minimalistic `TODO` app built with **`Flutter`**. State management is handled by **`Riverpod`**, and local databases **`Isar`** and **`Hive`** provide efficient data storage. The project follows **`Clean Architecture`** principles for a modular codebase.
